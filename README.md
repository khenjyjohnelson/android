# omnitags-android
 This is the place where I experiment with omnitags and it's implementation in android. The purpose of this project is to be able to make framework implementation easier than just project copy and paste which takes a lot of time to do. I want just to do it with branches.

Hereâ€™s an example of a **typical README file for an Android project**. You can customize it based on your project's specific details.
